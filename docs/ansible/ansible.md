# Ansible

Ansible is an open-source IT automation tool used for:

- Provisioning
- Configuration management
- Application deployment
- Orchestration

It is **agentless**, uses **SSH/WinRM**, and relies on **YAML playbooks**.

!!! note
Ansible focuses on configuration management, while Terraform focuses on infrastructure provisioning.

# What existed before Ansible?

- Bash / Shell scripts
- Python scripts
- Puppet and Chef (agent-based, steeper learning curve)
- Terraform (still used, but different scope)
